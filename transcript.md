# Introduction

### Welcome to country

I wish to begin by acknowledging the Wurundjeri people, the traditional owners of the land on which we are gathered today. We pay our respects to the local people for allowing us to have our gathering on their land and to their Elders; past, present and future.

Thanks everyone for coming today, and a huge thanks to Ben and Rick for convening an event as amazing as Buzzconf Nights.

#Overview

SLIDE: Ursula from the Little Mermaid

So, hi! My name is Kathy and I'm a control *enthusiast*. I like controlling things. This talk though won't be about world domination, so if you were here for *that* controlling the future talk, well let's talk later :D *evil fingers*

What we *are* here to talk about today is the future of user interfaces. I'm going to spend a couple of minutes going retro, so we can appreciate just how far we've come in a short period of time. Then, we're going to explore some of the newer user interface approaches that are emerging, such as;

SLIDE: Overview of topics covered

* conversational user interfaces and speech recognition - and I'm going to let you play with Dino here - a toy which uses speech recognition to keep children entertained and learning.

* we'll talk about the rise of natural user interfaces - things like gesture control - everyone remember Minority Report, where Tom Cruise was controlling things on screen like this *demonstrates gesture control*? I've also got my Ninja Sphere here and will show you how that works.

* we're also going to chat a little bit about emotional user interfaces, and neural interfaces, and how they're developing. Who wants to control your devices with the POWER OF YOUR MIND???!!! :-)

* we're going to explore some of the different characteristics, commonalities and differences in user interface development, and do some thinking around what it will mean to control your environment in the future.

## Questions

I'd love to hear your questions, however I think for the ease of microphones and audio, do write them down or remember them, and I'd be delighted to respond to them at the end of the talk.


# History

So, to see where we're going, let's spend a brief moment going back, BACK IN TIME!

SLIDE: Punch cards

Some of you may be seasoned enough to remember punch cards - anyone? With punch cards you literally had to punch holes into these cards, then load a bunch of them into a computer which was about the size of a house, and wait to see if you had a syntax error, then repeat the process when you realised you'd missed a semicolon. *sigh*

SLIDE: Old fashioned keyboards

Then came these

SLIDE: Macintosh mouse

And then we had graphics input devices

SLIDE: Wacom graphics tablet

And then we had touch screen devices themselves, such as phones and tablets

SLIDE: ASUS Transformer Trio

This is actually the device I'm using today

So basically for the last 10 years or so, we haven't seen any massive paradigm shifts in user interfaces. The input devices themselves have got incrementally more useful and more sophisticated, we have wireless, we have bluetooth, we have less cords - which is great.

# Trends and the drivers for user interface paradigm shifts

But there's a number of trends which are driving changes in user interface paradigms. Let's have a look at them.

## Mobile

SLIDE: Lego chains

Firstly, we're not chained to our desks anymore. We work mobile. We have laptops, smartphones, wearables - and if you saw my talk at BuzzConf festival last year, you'll know that soon we'll all have implantables as well!

So we need user interfaces that move with us.

Secondly, we don't want to carry a range of user input devices with us - we're mobile. We're commuting in trains, we're hot desking even if the organisations we work for have actual offices, we're working from coffee shops. We need the user interface to fit where we're working - or playing from - right now.

# Notes
Gartner  from graphical UI to environmental UI - using the environment to control systems
Drivers for change in user interfaces - computing has moved away from the desktop and into mobile devices and wearables - we're no longer at our desks - but the GUI remains, albeit with a touch interface on phones.
Touch interface also seen on wearables - for instance, you tap your fitbit to get information displayed.
What about the Pebble - with the pebble it's still the push of a button to control the interface - but the content is actually driven from a second devices
This could be a good segue into Machine 2 Machine interface - one machine controlling another in response to environmental stimuli.

Adoption - many different people are adopting technology - different languages, different cultural context and different physical abilities - for intance an aging population, who may have difficulty with text, or medical conditions such as stroke which may impair speech.

Sophistication - people are becoming more accepting of technology and are adopting it in many different use cases - they *expect* more user interfaces.

Is this complexity a bad thing? Interfaces are interaction languages - with a syntax and expected response - if I double click this element, then it should respond in this way. Is the explosion of different ways to interface with systems becoming a burden - a cognitive burden? Or will our brains be elastic and just attune or adjust to the propagation of so many different interfaces? Do we need to stop or deprecate some of the interfaces we have to make room?

Evolution of the desktop interface - touch gestures - pinch, zoom, twist
Use of scribes, pens, surface 3 - perhaps our fingers are too fat.
We're still a little way away from the Minority report style gesture control - but with things like the Kinect it's likely to be here soon.

For all the talk of gesture control, tablet control etc, there's still research and development going on established devices - such as keyboards.

Koskela - *pattern control* versus *instant control*
context aware functions - context menus - but now we're seein physical context - environmental UIs.

What happens when environmental UIs and emotional UIs collide?
Conversational UIs that can tell when people are pissed off?
Will the colour of digital signage change to something more soothing?

Trust in the user interface - what happens then the user interface is not just around us, but inside us?

From Gartner - "The UI shifts from GUIs attached to individual devices to an "environmental user interface," acting as a contextual user access and information delivery engine across multiple devices." - creating a proactive UI framework for the environment

So what are the implications for this for practitioners
* you don't just need a UI framework for something like web or mobile interfaces - your UI framework needs to be an *environmental interaction* framework that has seamless, familiar interfaces for things like touch, gesture control, conversational UI and digital signage, emotional response etc - it's an interaction guide, not a web user interface guide. How is this tied to branding? How many company style guides are still print based, with a concession to web user interfaces? Style guides will become interaction guides - when a sound or gesture or even conversational UI is associated with a brand.

OK Google - Siri - they are part of larger brands.

Just like brands - interaction families will have a personality or flavour - for instance a corporate with a focus on efficiency may have an interaction family which is spartan, quick, with a minimum of movement or sound. A more social or fun brand may have an interaction family which focuses on lots of verbal interaction or fun gestures.

Location awareness and gaze tracking are needed for speech recognition - Microsoft paper - early 2000s

Ninja sphere - gesture control and swiping
Cognitoys Dino - voice recognition - toy interface design
Wiimote - take in the Wiimote to show off

Haber et al - intimate space, personal space, social space, public space - does the user interface know which one it's operating in?
